Internet Service Providers need to deploy and maintain many wireless sites in isolated or inaccessible terrain to provide Internet connectivity to rural communities. Addressing failures at such sites can be very expensive, both in identifying the fault, and also in the repair or rectification. Data monitoring can be useful, to spot anomalies and predict a fault (and possibly pre-empt it altogether), or to locate and isolate it quickly once it causes an issue for the network. There might be hundreds of variables to be monitored in principle, but only a few of significance for detecting faults. Here, in a case study involving a Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP) in a rural area, we first illustrate a bottom-up approach to the identification of variables likely to be of use in an automatic anomaly detector. For the purpose of this study, the detector consists of an autoencoder neural network with weights optimized by machine learning (ML). We then show how the cause of an anomaly can be derived from indirect measurements, and use the model to learn relationships between certain variables.
